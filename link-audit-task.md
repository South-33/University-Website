# Website Link Audit & Clean URL Verification Task

## Project Overview
After fixing the critical navigation bug in main.js, we need to ensure all internal links across the website use clean URLs and have proper URL mappings configured.

## Main Tasks

### 1. URL Mapping Verification
- [x] Review all URL mappings in main.js ✅
- [x] Ensure every linked page has a corresponding mapping ✅
- [x] Add missing mappings for any pages that need them ✅
- [x] Verify mapping paths match actual file locations ✅

**COMPLETED MAPPING ADDITIONS:**
- Added trailing slash URL mappings (`/programs/`, `/campus/`, `/academic-ecosystem/`, `/study-with-us/`)
- Added complete student-activities section mappings (`/student-activities/`, `/student-activities/clubs`, `/student-activities/events`, `/student-activities/gallery`, `/student-activities/student-voice`)
- All referenced URLs now have proper mappings in main.js

### 2. Navigation Link Audit by Section

#### Main Navigation & Footer
- [x] Header navigation links ✅ (clean URLs verified)
- [x] Footer links ✅ (clean URLs verified)
- [x] Breadcrumb navigation (if any) ✅ (clean URLs verified)

#### Programs Section
- [x] Main programs page (`programs/index.html`) ✅ (clean URLs verified)
- [x] Bachelor's programs page (`programs/bachelors.html`) ✅
- [x] All 9 faculty pages:
  - [x] Faculty of Management ✅
  - [x] Faculty of Finance and Accounting ✅
  - [x] Faculty of Economics ✅
  - [x] Faculty of Tourism ✅
  - [x] Faculty of Law ✅
  - [x] Faculty of Digital Economy ✅
  - [x] Faculty of Public Policy ✅
  - [x] Faculty of Foreign Languages ✅ (already clean)
  - [x] Faculty of IT ✅
- [x] Masters programs page ✅ (URL mapping added)
- [x] Doctoral programs pages ✅ (links fixed to point to main doctoral page)
- [x] Robotic Engineering page ✅

#### Other Main Sections
- [x] Campus pages (`campus/`) ✅ (all clean URLs verified)
- [x] Academic Ecosystem pages (`academic-ecosystem/`) ✅ (all clean URLs verified)
- [x] Study With Us pages (`study-with-us/`) ✅ (all clean URLs verified)
- [x] Main index page ✅ (clean URLs verified)
- [x] Contact page ✅ (created basic contact page with form and university info)

### 3. Link Format Standards
All internal links should follow these patterns:
- ✅ **Correct**: `/programs/bachelors` (clean URL, no .html)
- ❌ **Incorrect**: `../bachelors.html` (relative path with extension)
- ❌ **Incorrect**: `/programs/bachelors.html` (absolute path with extension)

### 4. Testing Checklist
- [x] Test navigation from homepage to all main sections ✅
- [x] Test faculty page navigation (all 9 pages) ✅
- [x] Test "Learn More" buttons on all faculty pages ✅
- [x] Test back/forward browser navigation ✅
- [x] Verify no 404 errors in console ✅
- [x] Verify smooth SPA transitions ✅

## Current Status

### Recently Fixed
✅ **Faculty of IT page**: Updated all "Learn More" buttons to use clean URLs
✅ **Main.js click handler**: Fixed critical navigation bug
✅ **Robotic Engineering mapping**: Added clean URL mapping
✅ **URL Mapping Completion**: Added all missing URL mappings including trailing slash URLs and student-activities section
✅ **Final Audit**: Verified all internal links use clean URLs and have proper mappings

### Known Issues - ALL RESOLVED! ✅
- ✅ **FIXED**: Contact page created - comprehensive contact page with form, contact info, and proper navigation
- ✅ All faculty pages now have consistent clean URL link formats
- ✅ All major sections verified to use clean URLs
- ✅ URL mapping added for masters programs page
- ✅ All internal links across the website now use clean URLs

## AUDIT COMPLETE! ✅

### What Was Accomplished:
1. ✅ **ALL faculty page links fixed** - Updated all 8 remaining faculty pages to use clean URLs
2. ✅ **All URL mappings completed** - Added missing mappings for masters programs, trailing slash URLs, and student-activities section
3. ✅ **All main sections audited** - Campus, Study-with-us, Academic Ecosystem, Student Activities all verified clean
4. ✅ **Contact page created** - Fixed broken /contact link with comprehensive contact page
5. ✅ **Doctoral program links fixed** - Updated to point to main doctoral page
6. ✅ **All clean URL standards implemented** - No .html extensions found in any internal links
7. ✅ **Complete URL mapping coverage** - Every referenced URL now has proper mapping in main.js
8. ✅ **Navigation system fully functional** - SPA navigation works seamlessly with clean URLs

## Notes
- The clean URL system is already implemented and working
- URL mappings are defined in `/js/main.js` in the `urlMapping` object
- All faculty pages should link to each other using clean URLs
- The SPA navigation system handles URL rewriting client-side
- Vercel.json configuration supports clean URLs on the hosting side

## Next Steps
Start with a systematic check of all faculty pages since these are most actively used, then expand to other sections of the website.
