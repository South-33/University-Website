The digital shift has interconnected the real and virtual worlds, and we have adapted by upgrading our curricula, renovating both physical and digital smart classrooms, and enhancing technical labs. These improvements are designed to meet the evolving needs of our students through our network of university partners and industry linkages.

I am pleased to share that NUM has advanced in internationalization through our partnerships with global networks (Erasmus+, GBSN, AUN, AUF, CORE Economic), our inclusion in international university rankings (WURI), and our international student exchange and dual degree programs. Currently, NUM operates two campuses: the historic Wat Phnom main campus, which offers programs in business, management, finance, and accounting, and the new Veal Sbov satellite campus, which focuses on digital economy, science, and technology.

In conclusion, my faculty colleagues and I are committed to meeting our students' expectations by fostering their success in active learning and research. We emphasize personal growth in essential skills such as research, analysis, writing, presentation, and leadership.

A Glance At NUM
National University of Management’s story is parallel with Cambodia’s socio-economic rehabilitation period in the post Khmer Rouge era. Founded in 1983, NUM was initially an institute that provided educational programs in agriculture, industry, finance, and planning. Over time, this institute evolved both in depth and breadth and has contributed to Cambodia’s socio-economic development, particularly in the area of human capital development.

In response to political and economic reform towards democracy and free market, the institute was renamed to Faculty of Business (FOB) in 1994. It launched academic programs in management, marketing, accounting, and finance. Four years later, FOB was renamed to the National Institute of Management (NIM) and the first private tuition programs were introduced in 1998. In 2004, the academic role of NIM was broadly expanded and then became the National University of Management. Soon afterward, NUM was accredited to full status as a public non-profit administration in 2005. Up until 2005, the National University of Management was comprised of seven academic faculties and departments, and a graduate school that offered post-graduate programs including master's degrees and doctoral programs.

In 2011, an International College which was located inside the National University of Management was established. It offers two academic programs which are International Business (iBBA) and Global Entrepreneurship & Innovation. In addition, new international academic programs, international bachelor of law, supply chain management, digital economy, financial technology, and smart city planning management, were introduced in order to respond to the human capital's emerging need for the development of industry 4.0 in Cambodia.

Currently, NUM has total student population of 13,147 and an alumni community of more than 60 thousand. NUM has 9 faculties, 1 graduate school, and 8 academic and professional centers, institute, laboratories. Recently, the university inaugurated a satellite campus that hosts international programs pertaining to industrial 4.0 and envisages to develop new academic programs in response to Cambodia’s development need.

Attesting to our commitment and remarkable progress toward academic excellence and innovation, the World University Ranking for Innovation (WURI) ranked us 72nd among the global innovative universities in 2023.

Our university is physically positioned at the heart of Phnom Penh Capital. Our main campus has a long history serving as an infrastructure for education since mid-20th century. Its physical appearance is carefully and innovatively preserved and its purpose remains unchanged – a place to cultivate human capital for Cambodia. At the same time, we are expanding our satellite campus at an emerging commercially living district in Phnom Penh. This satellite campus is dedicated to new international programs and future academic programs development.

Our faculties are diverse and well positioned in an educational environment that aims to nurture future talents of Cambodia. About 20 percent of our faculty members have post-graduate background from both renowned domestic and international graduate schools. They are not only academic professionals, but industrial experts who bring know-how knowledge and best practices to their classes.

In 2023, our university board approved on the five-years strategic plan 2024-2028 that aims to support effective implementation of the university’s mission and realization of the university’s long-term vision. During the stated period, our priorities will be placed on enhancing quality of education in line with industrial revolution 4.0, promoting research and innovation, developing strategic partnerships, strengthening good governance and human resource management, and developing financial sustainability.

NUM’s story has been shared among our community, Cambodian and international talents who we nurtured, and partners who we collaborated with. They are multipliers of positive impact that we deliver to Cambodia and beyond. NUM footprint will be left for many years to come, and her story will continue and be shared and remembered by many.

This campus was provided by the Ministry of Education Youth and Sport to develop to Satellite Campus which equipping with state-of-the-art infrastructure and technologies. At the time the piece of land provided to NUM, it has two unusable buildings and gigantic lake with depth water and very small road to access to.

The National University of Management is honored to be selected by the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports to establish an institute to support academic research with a focus on economic issues and policy development in line with a particular focus on the establishment of the Asian Economic Community (AEC). The establishment of the ASEAN Economic Research Institute confirms NUM’s commitment to enhance and encourage research among faculties in the area of economic strategy and policy. The initial impetus for this project comes from Cambodia taking the Chair of ASEAN in 2022 and it is expected that research will be initially driven by the theme and direction of Cambodia’s chairmanship in continuing the development of AEC in line with the ASEAN Charter. Once established research will continue to explore the ongoing development to AEC Blueprint 2025 and beyond.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE INSTITUTE
- Study economic development strategies of ASEAN member countries and provide inputs for Cambodian policy markers to enhance the competitiveness of the Cambodian economy.
- Liaise with policy makers, the business community, and NGOs to identify priorities and areas of support as the development of AEC continues.
- Encourage close and beneficial cooperation with other educational and regional organizations within the ASEAN community.

We encourage students to take part in exchange programs, where they can spend a semester or year studying at a partner university overseas. At NUM, students have endless opportunities to broaden their horizons and expand their skill set through international experiences.

Cultural Exchange
The university promotes culture and tradition to our diverse student body. From hosting cultural festivals and events, we aim to foster a sense of appreciation and respect for our national identity and tradition.

Ethical Value and Social Responsibility
Our students are equipped with both moral value and a sense of high responsibility. We believe that their actions as students in the present time shall determine their conduct in the future as professionals, corporate managers, enterprise leaders, and change-makers. The contribution that they make will generate a positive impact to society and respective communities of their profession.

Students should have ethical values and social responsibility because it helps them become better citizens and contribute positively to society. Ethical values teach students how to make good decisions based on principles that guide their behavior. It helps them to act with integrity and honesty, and to be transparent in their dealings. Social responsibility helps students understand their role in building a better community and protecting the environment. It encourages them to take active roles in volunteering, supporting charities and engaging in sustainable practices. By practicing ethical values and social responsibility, students will develop strong character and leadership skills that will serve them well throughout their lives.
